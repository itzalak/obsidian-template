## Introduction

Obsidian is a flexible note taking app that allows me to use my current zettlekasten template and markdown type file to save notes.

The goal is to use flexibly obsidian and zettlekasten to save notes and using a generic markdown file based on a defined template and save it using a git repository.

An added benefit would be to be able to easily sync with smartphone - without cost.

Obsidian saves notes in markdown format in a vault - or folder - where it also stores all the configuration and plugins.
## Features

* Create zettlekasten style notes based on template [[scratch-template]]
* Write down ideas of projects I want to try via template [[idea-template]]
* Maintain a journal under `journal/sprint` and connected tasks under `journal/tasks
* Be able to edit and adjust outside of obsidian.
